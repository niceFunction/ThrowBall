Make sure to:

1. In the Player prefab (In the "Ball Throw" script), add "Main Camera" to Player camera
2. Have a Cinemachine Virtual Camera added to the scene (who's inside the player character)
3. Add to the Cinemachine Virtual Camera, the "Cinemachine POV Extension" script
4. If necessary, Add the "Crystal Ball" prefab as a reference to "Ball" & "Ball Body"

Side Note:
Player prefab have some of the references needed if it's missing something, otherwise check the "Crystal Ball" prefab
